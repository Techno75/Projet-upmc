This briefing will offer media the opportunity to raise questions on general refereeing matters during the first 44 matches of the FIFA Womenâ€™s World Cup Franceâ„¢. As expected, there has been considerable interest related to the use of video assistant referees (VAR) and the media briefing will also be used as a platform to answer any questions you may still have with regard to how VAR works, as well as its use in the tournament so far. Please note that only media accredited for the FIFA Womenâ€™s World Cup will be able to access the venue."},
